The freedom project tool that I am doing for this year is kaboom, which uses javascript to help people create games that are fun with effects and I have been learning about its features and code, processing things in my learning log trying to create a game where it is fun and interactive, where it is like a battle royale game where you obtain a health bar in the beginning and after an enemy dies there will be an explosion, using kaboom to help me with the effect. The objective is to basically just be the last one standing. I intended to make a game that can be played offline because nowadays there aren't many games that are offline and fun, most of the fun games today are mostly online and need wifi. I'm trying to create a game for people who maybe don't have access to data or wifi always, where it is fun and interactive. It has been a little hard to find videos and websites to help with my learning but these are the videos that I have processed into my learning log that has helped me. I used the [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup) and found a [kaboom animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-q0pKGhxyw) I took all the learning from here and tried to create something similar in [pickcode](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cmg5b8cve009okj2ewj08abpy), I tested out different things here and tinkered with code. For example there was code inside the pickcode that was programmed to move a specific sprite using arrow keys. This was the original code 
```js
onKeyDown("left", () => {
            player.move(-SPEED, 0);
        });

        onKeyDown("right", () => {
            player.move(SPEED, 0);
        });

        onKeyDown("up", () => {
            player.move(0, -SPEED);
        });

        onKeyDown("down", () => {
            player.move(0, SPEED);
        });
```
I in turn wondered what if I could change the arrow keys to a random key on a keyboard such as w,a,s, and d. SO I tried testing my idea out and it looked like this.
```js
 onKeyDown("s", () => {
            player.move(-SPEED, 0);
        });

        onKeyDown("a", () => {
            player.move(SPEED,0 );
        });

        onKeyDown("w", () => {
            player.move(0, -SPEED);
        });

        onKeyDown("d", () => {
            player.move(0, SPEED);
        });
```
I moved the one that said left arrow to a and when I clicked it moved my sprite. I used my own imagination to wonder what would happen if I did this to the code like changingthe arrow keys to letter keys. These were just some of the ways that I used my imagination to tinker with my code and change things that I was curious about. 

# Engineering Design Process 
Right now on the engineering design process I just finished defining the problem which is trying to develop this offline game where people who enjoy it and not play the game once and just get bored of it, trying to add like some cool effects to it so that it looks more interesting and cool, while I finished defining the problem I moved onto the researching of the problem, trying to find ways online, like features that will make my game stand out, adding things in my game that makes online games interesting and interactive. I have been reading a [article](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/software-development/character-controls-camera-3cs-game-development#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20first%20things,Character%2C%20Controls%2C%20Camera'.) on game development to help me create this.  

# Skills

## Time management 
As of now in junior year workloads pile up and I joined the basketball team and it is important that I keep a schedule because practices are really often and they are usually at a really late time so it leaves me not much time to do my homework and also do other work such as the freedom project. Right now I have dedicated some time to the freedom project and researching some ideas. After I finish all my work I spend around 5 minutes a day just brainstorming a little bit despite all the work that I have. However I also try to leave some free time for myself in the end to just relax because it is important that once in a while you get a break and relax because putting so much stress on yourself is not good. Just creating a schedule that you can follow everyday and making sure that you finish everything and that you put the work with deadlines first and also leaving some time to relax and process everything. 

# Hardwork/Perserverance
As work gets harder for me I feel like I just want to get my work done and just finish with it. Sometimes I don't even feel like doing the work but I push myself everyday that even if I am tired I must continue. When I'm committed to my work I have full concentration on it without stopping and no distractions. I make sure that the job is done before I move on or take a break and I keep pushing myself to try my best and bring in better work quality to my assignments. Even when I get an assignment I don't understand, I still try my best to solve it and if I cannot then I ask a friend for help or search online but for me failure and giving up is not an option for me. The freedom project for example, it was hard for me to find a video that was good and related to kaboom that I could learn but after taking a long time and not giving up I found a good video and took notes. This showed how I persevered and got through it.
