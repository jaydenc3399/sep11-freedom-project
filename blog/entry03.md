From my last blog entry I have just been addng onto my learning log. I would say that it is hard to find videos online youtube because they only show videos of people building websites and not really the fundamentals of kaboom. For now I have been using Ai to give me topics that I would need for the games. I asked it for a bullet point list and I found which one matched and that I did not use. With this I grabbed the topic that I did not do and had the right criterias. I would take this and copy the topic to google and youtube to look for lessons
